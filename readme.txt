Enables you to give a link to anonymous users for public preview of a post before it is published.

== Description ==

Enables you to give a link to anonymous users for public preview of a post before it is published.

Have you ever been writing a post with the help of someone who does not have access to your blog and needed to give them the ability to preview it before publishing? This plugin takes care of that by generating a URL with an expiring nonce that can be given out for public preview.

Props to [Jonathan Dingman](http://www.ginside.com/) for the idea behind this plugin, testing and feedback.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `public-post-preview` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install directly through the plugin installer.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or by using the link provided by the plugin installer

NOTE: See "Other Notes" for Upgrade and Usage Instructions as well as other pertinent topics.

1. Delete the previous `public-post-preview` folder from the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Usage ==
